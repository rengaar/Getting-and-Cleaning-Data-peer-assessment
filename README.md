1. The raw data are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Copy the data and the script run_analysis.R into your working directory
3. Run the script by source("run_analysis.R")
4. After running the script, you get two tables created in your working directory:
	1) merged_data.txt contains the processed data
	2) data_with_means.txt contains only the means for each subject of the experiment
